# PythonGamePackage
 A collection of games I have made in Python.

These games were all made by me, HalfMeridian, with some help by some friends. They should be enjoyed, I feel, so
I have decided that they should go more open. Please tinker and play with these games! They can all be run using simple Python,
but some may require Pygame as well. They were developed on an Intel-Macbook, but they should be cross compatible with
any device that has the ability to run python. I will not help you troubleshoot any errors.

With all that being said, I hope you have fun!
